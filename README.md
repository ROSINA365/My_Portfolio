[Project 1: Prediction of Heart Disease : Project Overview](https://github.com/ROSINA365/Prediction-of-Heart-Disease)
<ul>
<li>Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s very Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand.</li>
<li>Basing on the dataset , the analysis mainly focuses on which patient is more
likely to have a heart disease based on various medical attributes. </li>
<li>Prepared a heart disease prediction system to predict whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with a heart disease or not
using the medical history of the patient.</li>
<li>Used different R programming libraries such as ggplot, corrplot, and Tidyverse which is R package for data science.</li>

 </ul>.

<p> From the above Bar Chart we can observe the total number of patients having or not having Heart
 Disease. 
 Conclusion form the above observation is that there are more cases of patients getting heart disease through the variable target.</p> 
<p> These variable targets are Resting Blood Pressure, Chest Pain, Fasting Blood Sugar , sex and age group of the patients. </p>

<h4>The Histogram below shows the risk of heart disease basing on the age of the patient.</h4>

<p>From the observation, many people are from the age of 55 to 60 are at a high risk of getting the heart disease compared to the younger ages.<p>
 
 <h4>Patients having High Blood Pressure on the basis of Sex.</h4>

 <p>
 Using Box Plot to compare Blood Pressure with Chest Pain on the basis of Sex.</P>
 
<p>from the above box plot we can see that the male experience the highest blood pressure when they get the ATYPICAL ANGINE chest pain compared to women</p>


[Project 2: Covid-19 Exploratory Analysis : Project Overview](https://github.com/ROSINA365/covid-19-analysis)
<ul>
 <li>Perfomed exploratory analysis on Covid-19 from a dataset acquired from Kaggle</li>
 <li>Main aim was to relate different variables with one another to see the linear relationship they have</li>

</ul>
