[Project 1: Prediction of Heart Disease : Project Overview](https://github.com/ROSINA365/Prediction-of-Heart-Disease)
<ul>
<li>Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate.</li>
<li>Itâ€™s very Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand.</li>
<li>Basing on the dataset , the analysis mainly focuses on which patient is more
likely to have a heart disease based on various medical attributes. </li>
<li>Prepared a heart disease prediction system to predict whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with a heart disease or not
using the medical history of the patient.</li>
<li>Used different R programming libraries such as ggplot, corrplot, and Tidyverse which is R package for data science.</li>

 </ul>.

<p> From the above Bar Chart we can observe that there are more cases of patients getting heart disease through the variable target.</p> 
<p> These variable targets are Resting Blood Pressure, Chest Pain, Fasting Blood Sugar , sex and age group of the patients. </p>

<h4>The Histogram below shows the risk of heart disease basing on the age of the patient.</h4>
